# ABCD x 4 = DCBA

# (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) X 4 = 1000D + 100C + 10B + A

# 4000A + 400B + 40C + 4D = 1000D + 100C + 10B + A
# 39B + 3 = 6C
# 13B + 1 = 2C
# (13B + 1)/2 = C
# 
#
#

# A < 3 and A > 0 and A < 10
# A % 2 == 0 must be even as it is multiplied by two
# A = 2
# D > 7 and D < 10 D must be greater than 7 as D is the 1000's place in DCBA, and A in ABCD is 2000x4
# D = 8
# B = 1. If B is greater than 1 next possible is 3 for (13B + 1)/2 = C to be even , which gives 39 +1 = 40/2 -> 20 for C and 1200 for B and 
# thus exceed the 8000 cap set for A = 2 where  # 4000A + 400B + 40C + 4D = 1000D + 100C + 10B + A
#C = 7

# 8000+400+280+32 = 8000 + 700 + 10 + 2
# 8400 + 280 + 32 = 8712
# 8680 + 32
# 8712
